===========
Description
===========


This plugin works by adding extra content to the HTML report generated by **pytest-html** and **allure**.

The plugin is suitable for both front-end tests (Selenium or Playwright) and back-end tests.

The test steps are composed by the following parts:

* Comment or description.

* Screenshot (if applicable).

* Source of the webpage where the screenshot was taken (if applicable).

**pytest-report-extras** integrates with:

* `Selenium <https://www.selenium.dev/>`_

* `Playwright <https://playwright.dev/python/>`_

* `Allure Report <https://allurereport.org/>`_

Docstring of tests are also included in the report, as mean to provide a long description of tests.
Therefore, you are highly encouraged to document your tests with docstrings.


Limitations
===========

* Limited support for the ``--self-contained-html`` option of the **pytest-html** plugin. The report still contains links for attachments of unsopported mime types.

* No support for any kind of parallel tests execution (multi-treads, multi-tabs or multi-windows).

* For Playwright, only **sync_api** is supported.

* When using **Allure** with **pytest-bdd**, the **allure-pytest** plugin should be installed instead of **allure-pytest-bdd**.
